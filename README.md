### Singal Variable Linear Regression.

<p>Here we will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.</p>

<p>You would like to use <a href = 'https://github.com/bheemnitd/SINGLE-FEATURE-LINEAR-REGRESSION-FROM-SCRATCH-WITH-NUMPY/blob/master/ex1data1.txt'>this</a> data to help you select which city to expand
to next.The file <a href = 'https://github.com/bheemnitd/SINGLE-FEATURE-LINEAR-REGRESSION-FROM-SCRATCH-WITH-NUMPY/blob/master/ex1data1.txt'>ex1data1.txt</a> contains the dataset for our linear regression problem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is
the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a
loss.</p>
<table>
  <tr><h>
      <td>Population</td>
      <td>Profit</td>
      </h>
    </tr>
  
  <tr><td>6.1101</td><td>17.592</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5.5277</td><td>9.1302</td></tr>
  <tr><td>8.5186</td><td>13.662</td></tr>
  <tr><td>7.0032</td><td>11.854</td></tr>
  <tr><td>5.8598</td><td>6.8233</td></tr>
