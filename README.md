### SINGLE-FEATURE-LINEAR-REGRESSION-FROM-SCRATCH-WITH-NUMPY

<p>In this part of this exercise, we will implement linear regression with one variable to predict profits for a food truck. Suppose you are the CEO of a restaurant franchise and are considering different cities for opening a new outlet. The chain already has trucks in various cities and you have data for profits and populations from the cities.</p>

<p>You would like to use this data to help you select which city to expand
to next.The file ex1data1.txt contains the dataset for our linear regression prob-
lem. The first column is the population of a city and the second column is
the profit of a food truck in that city. A negative value for profit indicates a
loss.</p>
